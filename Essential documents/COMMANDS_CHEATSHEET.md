## 💡 Pro Tips

### ✨ Natural Variations Work!

All of these do the SAME thing:
- "show buttons"
- "show all buttons"
- "list the buttons"
- "could you show me the buttons"
- "i want to see buttons"
- "display all clickable buttons"
- "give me a list of buttons"

### 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Be specific when needed:**
   - Good: "click button submit"
   - Better: "click the submit button"

2. **Use numbers for lists:**
   - After "show buttons", say "three" to click button #3
   - Or say "what's three" to hear description first

3. **Speak naturally:**
   - You don't need to be robotic!
   - "Could you please..." works fine
   - "I want to..." works too

4. **Wait for feedback:**
   - System will confirm what it did
   - Listen for the spoken response

### 🔄 Typical Workflow

```
You:      "show links"
System:   [Highlights all links] "Found 8 links"

You:      "what's link three"
System:   [Highlights link 3] "Link 3 is About Us. Click it?"

You:      "yes"
System:   [Clicks link] "Clicked About Us"
```
